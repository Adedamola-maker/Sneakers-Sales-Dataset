 ### Conclusion and recommendation
 Recommendations	
	
Enhance In-Store Experience: Continue to invest in enhancing the in-store shopping experience through staff training, product displays, and customer engagement 	
strategies to maintain the current sales momentum.	
	
Boost Online Sales: Implement targeted marketing campaigns to promote online shopping, such as discounts, free shipping, or exclusive online offers. Improving website 	
usability and experience can also encourage more customers to shop online.	
	
Omni-Channel Strategy: Consider integrating both sales methods into a cohesive omni-channel strategy that allows customers to enjoy the benefits of both shopping 	
experiences. For example, offering in-store pickup for online orders could bridge the gap between the two methods.	
	
Monitor Trends: Keep an eye on market trends and consumer behavior to adapt strategies as necessary. Regularly collect customer feedback to understand their 	
preferences and pain points related to both shopping methods.	
	
Conclusion	
In-store sales outperform online sales, generating approximately $1.17 million compared to $1.03 million. While in-store shopping remains the preferred method for many 	
consumers, there is significant potential for growth in online sales. By enhancing both sales methods and integrating them into a cohesive strategy, the business can better 	
meet consumer needs and maximize overall sales performance.
For Nigeria: Maintain momentum by investing in technology and infrastructure to support further growth.	
For Ghana and Egypt: Focus on economic reforms and attracting foreign investment to capitalize on growth potential.	
For South Africa and Senegal: Address economic challenges through policy reforms and infrastructure development to improve market conditions and boost sales.
